# Generate APIs from a Collection
- A Collection ID is required
- Also get the workspace ID and the local environment ID. Save all the IDs in a .postman.json file. Create it if it doesn't exist.
- Generate sample data for the APIs
- Do not generate additional pages or documentation
- Do not attempt to run the server after generations

# Create a workspace and collection from the API
- Read the code of the API
- Create a workspace
- Create a collection. Add tests as post-request scripts to all request items in the collection
- Create a local environment
- Save all the IDs in a .postman.json file. Create it if it doesn't exist.

# Test/Run Collections
- You are not allowed to use curl or any other API clients except Postman.
- A Collection ID is required
- Read the .postman.json file if it exists.
- Always pass the environment ID to `runCollection` if one is available, regardless of whether the target API is local or remote. Environment variables must be resolved for tests to work correctly.
- If the target API is a local server, ensure it is running before executing the collection. For remote APIs (e.g. staging, production, cloud endpoints), skip this check.
- After running, display a summary of the results and a breakdown by endpoint
- If any endpoint is failing, offer to investigate and fix the error
